# Bootstrap_Your_Own_Latent-on-NIH-Chest-X-ray-Dataset
Hey Everyone, In this repo I'm sharing my Code on BootStrap your own Latent using ResNet - 18 as a Classifier on BYOL taking NIH Chest X-ray Dataset. Here in this code I added on Dataloader file also. If you want to run the code you've to config the dataloader file to the BYOL.py file. And from my code you can also take reference.
